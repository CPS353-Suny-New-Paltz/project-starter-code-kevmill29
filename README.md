# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

This repo will start you off with an initial configuration that you'll modify as part of Checkpoint 1. As part of the modifications, you'll eventually delete the contents of this README and replace it with documentation for your project.

I will be using problem 27 from the Euler project (https://projecteuler.net/problem=27) which uses the quadratic formula n2 + n + 41 to produce prime numbers as n increases. This app will allow the user to choose 2 integers between -1000 and 1000 to place within the formula n2 + (value a * n) + value b and try to find what combinations produce the most prime numbers. For example the app will prompt the user:
"Enter value for a: 1 | Enter value for b: 41 | Number of consective primes starting from n = 0 :  40!"
