# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

This project will feature Project Euler Problem 27, Quadratic Primes. The goal of this is to take the quadratic formula ie [(n * n) + an + b.] and figure out which combination of integers(with the limitation that it cannot be lower than -1000 and higher than 1000) can be used for variable a and variable b to find the highest numbers of primes with n starting at 0 and increasing. 

The project will prompt the user to input values for a and b and return a string which holds the result of the number of primes that can be found with these integers. 
Example:
Enter value for a:
1
Enter value for b:
41

Number of consecutive primes starting from n = 0 :  40
