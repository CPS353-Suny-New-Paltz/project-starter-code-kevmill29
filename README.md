# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

This project will feature Project Euler Problem 27, Quadratic Primes. The goal of this is to take the quadratic formula ie [(n * n) + an + b.] and figure out which combination of integers(with the limitation that it cannot be lower than -1000 and higher than 1000) can be used for variable a and variable b to find the highest numbers of primes with n starting at 0 and increasing.  Refer to : https://projecteuler.net/problem=27

The project will prompt the user for 2 locations: the input source where a file containing integers is located(only one variable will be needed which will be variable a as variable b will be randomly generated between -1000 and 1000) , and an output source where the answer key will be created and sent to by the program afterwards. 

Number of consecutive primes starting from n = 0 :  40
